E-commerce Customer Segmentation & Sales Analysis
This project is an end-to-end data analysis project that uses Python to analyze a sales dataset from an e-commerce platform. It demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from initial data cleaning and preprocessing to generating actionable business insights. The primary goal was to understand customer behavior and identify key customer segments to inform sales and marketing strategies.

Features-
Data Cleaning: Handled real-world data challenges by identifying and removing null values, correcting data types, and managing duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth analysis on various data attributes, including demographics (age, gender, marital status), location, and product categories to uncover underlying patterns.

Customer Segmentation: Identified key customer segments based on purchasing behavior. For example, the analysis revealed that married women in a specific age group and location were a significant customer segment.

Sales Insights: Provided a comprehensive summary of sales trends and purchasing patterns, highlighting popular product categories and seasonal sales fluctuations.

Visualization: Utilized Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that effectively communicate complex data findings.

Tools and Technologies-
Python: The core programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: The primary environment for executing the analysis and documenting the workflow.
